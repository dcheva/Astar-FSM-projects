# Pathfinding in Godot
This project aims to assist with various methods of pathfinding available in the Godot game engine.
Feel free to use any of the code/resources in this repository for whatever projects you'd like!

All the pathfinding example scenes can be opened from `res://scenes/all_pathfinding_examples/`, and run independently.
Scripts for each of these scenes can be found in the `res://scripts/` folder under the same directory.

>This project was created using Godot v.4.3.stable, but should be compatible with all 4.X versions.
